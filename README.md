## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores flight dataset trends and algorithm performance analysis across three main tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Temporal, Route & Delay Analysis
- Monthly and weekly flight volume analysis  
- Seasonality and busiest routes  
- Delay distribution by airline, route, and time of day  

### ⚙️ Task 2: Algorithms & Data Structures
- Sorting algorithm comparison: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick  
- Search performance: Linear vs Binary Search  
- Hash Tables & BSTs for flight record storage and queries  

### 🔗 Task 3: Graphs & Network Analysis
- Graph modeling of airports and flight routes using NetworkX  
- Connected components (BFS, DFS) and performance benchmarks  

---

## 📌 Key Results

- July is the busiest month; Saturdays see lowest traffic  
- JFK-LAX is the most trafficked route  
- Binary search and hash tables greatly outperform linear search  
- BFS is fastest; recursive DFS uses least memory

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `statistics`, `numpy`, `networkx`  
- Google Colab Notebooks (code pre-run and visualized online)

## 📁 Files
- `presentation.pdf`: full summary of the project  
- `code/`: all Python notebooks used for the analysis  
- `data/`: input datasets (local paths used; not included here)

## 🔍 How to Run

No setup required locally.  
👉 **Open the notebooks directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MpVmgc0AWSDwPVFTNV4qqiPgymtMUfIR?usp=sharing)** to view the full code and outputs.
All scripts have already been executed and visualized in Colab, using the appropriate datasets stored in local directories during development.
